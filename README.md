## Issues

Currently there are several issues that interfer with the page. 

Mobile responsive - Currently the app does not work well for certain mobile devices, causing an overflow of text in both axis. The Navbar is also difficult to navigate, and may be out of the screen view depending on the device. 

Contact page - The page refreshes every time after each keyboard input is added to the input text field. Also there is no backend API implemented at the moment, and so the submission will not go through.
